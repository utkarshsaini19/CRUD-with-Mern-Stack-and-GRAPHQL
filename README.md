# CRUD with Mern Stack and GRAPHQL

Link To The App :- https://fine-puce-hummingbird-cap.cyclic.app

 Basic CRUD App with Mern Stack and GRAPHQL queries.

 1. Created Query to fetch data in server.js File.
 2. Created Mutation to modify/update record/data on Backend.
 3. Created Resolver to handle Query and Mutation.
 4. Used Playground at localhost for Testing Quories and Mutation.
 5. Used Apollo Server Express at backend to form GQL Queries and Mutation Type.
 6. Used Apollo CLient at Frontend to interact with apollo server at backend.
 7. Used FetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network' so that if any changes occur between cached data and
    latest Data then updated Data will get Rendered on UI else Cache Data.
